# Video Processing Timeout Fixes Implemented

## Frontend Proxy Fixes (route.ts)
✅ **Increased Timeout**: Changed from 60s to 180s for video processing endpoints
✅ **Conditional Timeouts**: Different timeouts for different operations (health: 5s, video: 180s, default: 30s)
✅ **Retry Logic**: Added exponential backoff retry mechanism for video processing
✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better timeout error messages with operation context
✅ **Logging Improvements**: Added timeout duration to logs

## Backend API Fixes (videos.py)
✅ **Removed Blocking Metadata Fetch**: Moved `youtube_service.get_video_metadata()` from API endpoint to background task
✅ **Quick Response**: API now returns immediately after URL validation instead of waiting for metadata
✅ **Temporary Video Data**: Creates video record with placeholder data, updated by background task

## Background Task Fixes (video_tasks.py)
✅ **Added Timeout**: Added 120s timeout for metadata fetch operation
✅ **Improved Error Handling**: Better async operation handling

## Configuration Found
- Celery task timeout: 30 minutes (CELERY_TASK_TIME_LIMIT: 1800s)
- Worker timeout: 30 minutes (WORKER_TIMEOUT: 1800s)
- Backend has sufficient timeout settings

## Critical Issue Fixed
The main issue was that `youtube_service.get_video_metadata()` was blocking the HTTP response in the FastAPI endpoint. This call can take >60 seconds for certain videos due to:
1. YouTube anti-bot measures
2. Large video metadata processing
3. Network connectivity issues
4. Rate limiting

## Solution Summary
1. **Immediate Response**: API returns processing status immediately
2. **Background Processing**: All video metadata and processing happens asynchronously
3. **Longer Timeouts**: Frontend allows 3 minutes for processing requests
4. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
5. **Better Error Handling**: Clear timeout messages and operation context

## Next Steps
- Test the video processing flow
- Verify time series charts receive data
- Monitor for any remaining timeout issues
