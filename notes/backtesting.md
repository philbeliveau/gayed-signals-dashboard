Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's how backtesting is implemented for each of the three main tabs:

  Tab 1: Live Signals Dashboard (/src/app/page.tsx)

  No Backtesting - This tab displays real-time market signals only.

  - Purpose: Shows current market regime signals from Gayed research indicators
  - Data Source: Live API calls to /api/signals for real-time signal calculation
  - No Historical Analysis: This tab focuses on current market conditions, not historical testing

  Tab 2: Backtesting Laboratory (/src/app/backtest/page.tsx)

  Advanced Multi-Engine Backtesting System

  Architecture:

  - API Route: /src/app/api/backtest/route.ts:70
  - Orchestrator: /lib/backtesting/orchestrator.ts:74
  - SAFLA Integration: Safety validation throughout the process

  Backtesting Engines:

  1. Walk-Forward Analysis (/lib/backtesting/engines/walk-forward.ts:41)
    - Rolling window optimization with out-of-sample validation
    - Parameter optimization on in-sample data, testing on unseen data
    - Prevents lookahead bias
  2. Monte Carlo Simulation (/lib/backtesting/engines/monte-carlo.ts)
    - Statistical simulation with random scenarios
    - Tests strategy robustness across multiple market conditions
  3. Cross-Validation (/lib/backtesting/engines/cross-validation.ts)
    - Purged cross-validation to avoid look-ahead bias
    - Time-series aware validation splits
  4. Bootstrap Analysis (/lib/backtesting/engines/bootstrap.ts)
    - Bootstrap resampling for robust performance estimation
    - Statistical significance testing
  5. Synthetic Data Testing (/lib/backtesting/engines/synthetic-data.ts)
    - AI-generated synthetic market scenarios
    - Tests strategy under artificial but realistic conditions

  Process Flow:

  1. Strategy Builder: Define entry/exit rules, position sizing, rebalancing
  2. Configuration: Set date ranges, capital, risk parameters, commission rates
  3. Engine Selection: Choose which backtesting methodologies to run
  4. Execution: orchestrator.ts:74 coordinates all engines in parallel
  5. Results: Comprehensive performance metrics, risk analysis, statistical tests

  Key Features:

  - Multi-signal support: All 5 Gayed signals (Utilities/SPY, Lumber/Gold, Treasury Curve, S&P 500 MA, VIX Defensive)
  - Risk management: Max position size, drawdown limits, stop-losses
  - Performance metrics: Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Calmar ratio, VaR, maximum drawdown
  - Educational warnings: Built-in disclaimers about backtesting limitations

  Tab 3: Backtrader Analysis (/src/app/backtrader/page.tsx)

  Visual Chart-Based Backtesting

  Architecture:

  - API Route: /src/app/api/backtrader/route.ts:257
  - Python Service Integration: Connects to Python Backtrader service on port 5001
  - Mock Data Fallback: Generates realistic mock data when Python service unavailable

  Process Flow:

  1. Configuration: Select symbols, signals, timeframes, chart styles
  2. Analysis Request: route.ts:279 processes configuration and calls Backtrader service
  3. Chart Generation: Creates professional trading charts with signal overlays
  4. Performance Calculation: route.ts:58 generates comprehensive metrics
  5. Correlation Analysis: route.ts:87 analyzes signal-price relationships

  Features:

  - Visual Charts: Candlestick, OHLC, or line charts with signal overlays
  - Symbol Selection: 10 available symbols (SPY, XLU, WOOD, GLD, TLT, QQQ, IWM, VXX, DBA, USO)
  - Signal Integration: All 5 Gayed signals with detailed explanations
  - Performance Metrics: Returns, Sharpe ratio, drawdown, win rate, profit factor
  - Correlation Matrix: Signal-price correlation analysis with statistical significance
  - Educational Guidance: Detailed signal explanations and risk disclaimers

  Mock Data Generation:

  When Python service unavailable, the system generates realistic mock data:
  - Correlated Returns: Uses realistic asset correlations and market regimes
  - Market Regimes: Bull, bear, and sideways markets with appropriate volatility
  - Seasonal Effects: Santa rally, summer doldrums, sector rotation patterns
  - Volume Simulation: Realistic volume patterns based on volatility

  Summary

  Each tab serves a different backtesting purpose:

  1. Live Signals: Real-time market analysis (no backtesting)
  2. Backtesting Lab: Academic-grade comprehensive backtesting with multiple methodologies
  3. Backtrader Analysis: Visual chart-based backtesting with professional charting tools

  The system emphasizes educational use with extensive warnings about backtesting limitations and is designed for research and
  learning rather than live trading decisions.

‚è∫ Complete Solution: Real Backtesting System

  I've completely resolved all the issues you identified and created a proper real data backtesting system. Here's what I've built:

  ‚úÖ Problems Fixed

  1. Eliminated All Fake Data

  - ‚ùå Removed generateMockSignalTimeline()
  - ‚ùå Removed generateMockPerformanceMetrics()
  - ‚ùå Removed generateMockCorrelations()
  - ‚úÖ System now returns errors instead of fake data

  2. Chart Issues Resolved

  - ‚úÖ Symbol Names: Charts now clearly show "WOOD (Lumber ETF)" and "GLD (Gold ETF)"
  - ‚úÖ Date Axes: Proper date formatting on X-axis with real dates
  - ‚úÖ Signal Coherence: Signal timeline now matches actual price movements
  - ‚úÖ Interactive Charts: Replaced static SVG with interactive Recharts components

  3. Detailed Lumber/Gold Strategy Implementation

  - ‚úÖ Real Calculation: 91-day lookback period as per Gayed research
  - ‚úÖ Formula: Ratio = (Lumber_current/Lumber_91days_ago) / (Gold_current/Gold_91days_ago)
  - ‚úÖ Signal Logic: Ratio > 1.0 ‚Üí Risk-On (buy WOOD), Ratio < 1.0 ‚Üí Risk-Off (buy GLD)
  - ‚úÖ Real Trades: Actual trade execution with position sizing and risk management

  üöÄ New Interactive System

  Backtrader Analysis Tab - Now with Real Data

  1. Configuration: Select WOOD + GLD symbols with lumber_gold signal
  2. Real Data Fetching: Yahoo Finance API for actual market data
  3. Interactive Charts: Three chart views:
    - Asset Prices: WOOD vs GLD with signal markers
    - Lumber/Gold Ratio: Actual ratio calculation with 1.0 reference line
    - Strategy Performance: Complete trade history and analysis

  Performance Summary

  - Total Return, Annualized Return, Sharpe Ratio
  - Max Drawdown, Win Rate, Total Trades
  - All calculated from real trades based on real signals

  üìä How Lumber/Gold Strategy Works Now

  // 1. Fetch real WOOD and GLD data
  const marketData = await fetchRealMarketData(['WOOD', 'GLD'], startDate, endDate);

  // 2. Calculate 91-day ratios for each day
  for (let i = 91; i < alignedData.length; i++) {
    const current = alignedData[i];
    const lookback = alignedData[i - 91];

    // Calculate performance ratios
    const lumberRatio = current.lumberPrice / lookback.lumberPrice;
    const goldRatio = current.goldPrice / lookback.goldPrice;
    const lgRatio = lumberRatio / goldRatio;

    // Generate signal
    const signal = lgRatio > 1.0 ? 'Risk-On' : 'Risk-Off';
    const targetSymbol = signal === 'Risk-On' ? 'WOOD' : 'GLD';

    // Execute trades when signals change
    if (currentPosition !== targetSymbol) {
      // Close old position, open new position
      // Record actual trade with real prices
    }
  }

  // 3. Calculate performance from real trades
  const totalReturn = (finalValue - 100000) / 100000;

  ‚ùå "LUMBER/GOLD STRATEGY REQUIRES: WOOD and GLD symbols must be selected"
  ‚ùå "REAL DATA SERVICE REQUIRED: Python Backtrader service not available"

  üéì Educational Value

  The system now demonstrates:
  - ‚úÖ Importance of real market data in quantitative analysis
  - ‚úÖ Actual implementation of academic trading strategies
  - ‚úÖ Proper backtesting methodology with real trade execution
  - ‚úÖ Interactive visualization of strategy performance
  - ‚úÖ Data integrity and transparency in financial analysis
