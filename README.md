## üìä Signal Algorithms

### Michael Gayed's 5 Market Regime Signals

#### 1. üîå Utilities/SPY Signal (`utilities-spy.ts`)
- **Logic**: 21-day performance ratio of Utilities (XLU) vs S&P 500 (SPY)
- **Risk-On**: Utilities underperforming (ratio < 1.0) 
- **Risk-Off**: Utilities outperforming (ratio > 1.0)

#### 2. üèóÔ∏è Lumber/Gold Signal (`lumber-gold.ts`) 
- **Logic**: 13-week performance ratio of Lumber vs Gold
- **Risk-On**: Lumber outperforming Gold (growth > safety)
- **Risk-Off**: Gold outperforming Lumber (safety > growth)

#### 3. üìà Treasury Curve Signal (`treasury-curve.ts`)
- **Logic**: 10-year vs 30-year Treasury performance analysis
- **Risk-On**: Steep yield curve (economic expansion)
- **Risk-Off**: Flat/inverted curve (recession risk)

#### 4. üò± VIX Defensive Signal (`vix-defensive.ts`)
- **Logic**: Counter-intuitive VIX analysis
- **Risk-On**: High VIX (fear creates opportunities)
- **Risk-Off**: Low VIX (complacency increases risk)

#### 5. üìä S&P 500 Moving Average (`sp500-ma.ts`)
- **Logic**: Trend-following based on 50/200-day moving averages
- **Risk-On**: Above moving average with positive momentum
- **Risk-Off**: Below moving average with negative momentum

### Consensus Calculation
The **SignalOrchestrator** (`src/domains/trading-signals/engines/gayed-signals/index.ts`) combines all signals using confidence-weighted voting to generate overall market regime assessment.
