## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. PERF-001: 90-Second Conversation Timeout Violation

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Multiple sequential LLM calls with GPT-4 latency will likely exceed target
**Impact**: High (3) - User experience degradation, API timeouts, system unresponsiveness

**Mitigation**:
- Implement conversation streaming with partial results
- Add conversation complexity estimation before starting
- Configure shorter timeouts per agent turn (15-20 seconds max)
- Implement conversation caching for similar financial topics
- Add conversation abandonment with graceful fallback

**Testing Focus**:
- Load testing with realistic 3-agent conversation scenarios
- Timeout handling validation under various network conditions
- Performance monitoring with detailed timing metrics per agent

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 2. TECH-001: AutoGen Version Compatibility

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Framework in active development with frequent API changes
**Impact**: High (3) - Could require significant rework of agent implementations

**Mitigation**:
- Pin AutoGen versions in requirements.txt (>=0.2.0, <0.3.0)
- Implement adapter pattern for AutoGen API interactions
- Monitor AutoGen release notes for breaking changes
- Create version compatibility testing matrix

### 3. SEC-001: OpenAI API Key Exposure

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Common misconfiguration during development and deployment
**Impact**: High (3) - Financial liability, potential data exposure, service disruption

**Mitigation**:
- Use environment variables with secure defaults
- Implement secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager/Azure Key Vault)
- Add API key masking in all logs and error messages
- Regular security scanning for exposed credentials
- Implement API key rotation procedures

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Performance Testing**: Multi-agent conversation scenarios with 90-second timeouts
- **Load Testing**: Concurrent conversation handling under realistic user loads
- **Timeout Simulation**: Network latency and API response delay scenarios
- **Streaming Validation**: Partial result delivery and conversation state management

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Compatibility Testing**: AutoGen version matrix (0.2.0, 0.2.1, 0.2.2+)
- **Security Testing**: API key exposure scanning in logs, errors, and configurations
- **Integration Testing**: Mocked OpenAI responses and error handling
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variable and secrets rotation testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Memory Testing**: Long-running conversation memory leak detection
- **Initialization Testing**: Agent startup failure and recovery scenarios
- **Compliance Testing**: Financial disclaimer presence and accuracy
- **Data Retention**: Conversation cleanup and archival procedures

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- **PERF-001**: 90-second timeout must be reliably met (95% success rate)
- **SEC-001**: All API keys must be properly secured and masked
- **TECH-001**: AutoGen compatibility must be verified and stable

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **DATA-001**: Conversation retention policies documented and implemented
- **OPS-001**: Agent health checks and fallback mechanisms in place
- **TECH-002**: Memory monitoring and cleanup procedures active

### Accepted Risks
- **BUS-001**: Financial advice liability accepted with proper disclaimers and legal review

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

### Performance Metrics (PERF-001)
- Conversation completion times (P50, P95, P99)
- Timeout frequency and causes
- Agent response times per conversation turn
- API latency to OpenAI services

### Security Monitoring (SEC-001)
- API key usage patterns and anomalies
- Authentication failures and rate limiting
- Log scanning for credential exposure
- Secrets rotation compliance

### Operational Health (OPS-001, TECH-002)
- Agent initialization success rates
- Memory usage trends and garbage collection
- Error rates by agent type and conversation stage
- System resource utilization

### Business Metrics (BUS-001)
- User engagement with financial conversations
- Disclaimer acknowledgment rates
- Conversation quality feedback
- Regulatory compliance metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- AutoGen framework updates released (quarterly review minimum)
- OpenAI API changes or pricing modifications
- Performance degradation detected (>10% timeout increase)
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in dependencies
- Financial regulatory requirements change
- User feedback indicates conversation quality issues
- System architecture changes affecting agent interactions
