# Additional context
notes: |
  Implementation Quality: EXCELLENT
  - Schema design follows best practices with proper constraints and indexing
  - Pydantic model mapping is accurate and complete
  - Migration system properly initialized and tested
  - Prisma client configuration follows recommended patterns

  Documentation Quality: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
  - Path references don't match actual project structure
  - Missing implemented field in schema documentation

  Test Coverage: INSUFFICIENT
  - No database-specific tests present
  - Schema validation relies only on Prisma generate/push commands

  VERDICT: Production-ready implementation with documentation cleanup needed.
