# Final assessment
assessment_summary: |
  This WebSocket infrastructure implementation represents exceptional software engineering quality.
  The code demonstrates professional-grade architecture with comprehensive security, excellent
  TypeScript typing, and production-ready deployment configuration. All 10 acceptance criteria
  are fully implemented with robust error handling and scalable design patterns. This work sets
  a new quality standard for the project and should be used as a reference implementation for
  future infrastructure components.
