# Detailed findings summary
review_summary: |
  The LiveConversationDisplay component implementation is architecturally sound and meets all
  acceptance criteria. The code demonstrates good React patterns, proper TypeScript usage,
  comprehensive error handling, and excellent mobile responsiveness. The WebSocket integration
  is well-abstracted and the mock mode provides effective demonstration capabilities.

  However, there are test failures that need resolution and some type consistency issues in
  related files. The code quality is high but could benefit from extracting hardcoded
  configurations to improve maintainability.

  Build passes successfully and the component integrates well with the existing codebase
  patterns and theme system.
