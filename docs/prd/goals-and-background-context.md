# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Demonstrate Microsoft AutoGen's multi-agent capabilities through live financial content analysis debates
- Establish partnership pathway with Croesus (19,000+ users managing $2T AUM) for white-label integration
- Create transparent AI reasoning system that builds trust between financial advisors and clients
- Develop production-ready multi-agent architecture suitable for wealth management platform integration
- Validate market demand for transparent AI reasoning in financial services industry

## Background Context

The financial analysis industry suffers from "black box" decision-making where investment recommendations lack transparent reasoning processes. Only 35% of investors trust that their advisor always acts in their best interest, and financial advisors spend 36% of their time preparing explanations for client meetings. Current financial AI tools provide conclusions without showing analytical processes, creating a trust gap that transparent multi-agent debates can address.

This project leverages existing Gayed signals infrastructure and creates a standalone demonstration platform where three specialized AutoGen agents (Financial Analyst, Market Context, Risk Challenger) engage in live debates about financial content, providing a new category of transparent AI reasoning tools for partnership with wealth management platforms like Croesus.
