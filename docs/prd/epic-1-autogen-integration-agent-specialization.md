# Epic 1: AutoGen Integration & Agent Specialization

**Epic Goal:** Convert the existing sophisticated multi-agent framework to Microsoft AutoGen while preserving all current MCP integrations, Gayed signal data sources, and debate orchestration capabilities. This epic transforms your current custom agents into AutoGen-powered financial specialists that leverage existing infrastructure for transparent financial analysis debates.

## Story 1.1: AutoGen Framework Integration with Existing Architecture

**As a system architect,**
**I want Microsoft AutoGen integrated with our existing domain-driven architecture,**
**so that AutoGen agents can utilize current MCP services, Gayed signals, and market data infrastructure.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Microsoft AutoGen 0.2+ installed and configured within existing `/domains/ai-agents/` structure
2. AutoGen conversation manager integrated with current `orchestrator.ts` patterns
3. Existing MCP integrations (Perplexity, fact-checking) accessible to AutoGen agents
4. Current Gayed signal data (`/domains/trading-signals/engines/`) available to AutoGen agents
5. AutoGen agent initialization compatible with existing `base-architecture.ts` patterns
6. Conversation logging integrated with current monitoring and performance systems
7. Error handling and fallbacks maintain existing SAFLA validation and circuit breakers
8. AutoGen conversations stored using existing PostgreSQL/session management
9. Current Clerk authentication system protects AutoGen agent endpoints
10. Existing API routes (`/api/signals/`) enhanced to trigger AutoGen conversations

## Story 1.2: Financial Analyst AutoGen Agent Development

**As a financial professional,**
**I want a specialized Financial Analyst AutoGen agent that leverages existing Gayed signals,**
**so that I receive quantitative market analysis with historical context and confidence levels.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Financial Analyst agent extends existing `financial-agent.ts` patterns but uses AutoGen framework
2. Agent has direct access to current Gayed signal calculations from `SignalOrchestrator`
3. Agent incorporates existing enhanced market data from `EnhancedMarketClient`
4. Agent provides specific metrics, historical context, and confidence levels using current data sources
5. Agent personality and response patterns optimized for financial advisory use cases
6. Agent can analyze current signal states (Risk-On/Risk-Off/Neutral) with detailed reasoning
7. Agent responses include specific numerical data from existing signal calculations
8. Agent maintains conversation context and can reference previous analysis
9. Agent integrates with existing performance monitoring and error handling
10. Agent output format compatible with current dashboard display requirements

## Story 1.3: Market Context AutoGen Agent with MCP Integration

**As a financial advisor,**
**I want a Market Context AutoGen agent that provides real-time market intelligence,**
**so that I understand current economic conditions affecting signal analysis.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Market Context agent utilizes existing Perplexity MCP integration from current fact-checking system
2. Agent has access to existing FRED economic data through current `fred-api-client.ts`
3. Agent can query current economic indicators using existing `economic-data-pipeline.ts`
4. Agent provides real-time market news and context relevant to current signal states
5. Agent integrates breaking news analysis with quantitative signal data
6. Agent maintains awareness of Federal Reserve policy, employment data, and market developments
7. Agent responses contextualize current signals within broader economic environment
8. Agent leverages existing `web-search-service.ts` for additional market intelligence
9. Agent output includes specific references to current economic data and news sources
10. Agent conversations enhance rather than replace existing signal calculation accuracy

## Story 1.4: Risk Challenger AutoGen Agent Development

**As a risk-conscious investor,**
**I want a Risk Challenger AutoGen agent that systematically questions analysis,**
**so that I understand potential downsides and alternative interpretations of signals.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Risk Challenger agent provides systematic adversarial analysis of other agents' conclusions
2. Agent has access to existing backtesting data from `/domains/backtesting/engines/`
3. Agent can reference historical signal failure cases using existing performance metrics
4. Agent challenges assumptions using existing risk management utilities and validation
5. Agent provides contrarian viewpoints and stress testing scenarios
6. Agent identifies potential failure modes using existing Monte Carlo and bootstrap analysis
7. Agent questions market timing and signal reliability using historical data
8. Agent maintains professional skepticism while providing constructive alternative analysis
9. Agent responses include specific historical examples and statistical evidence
10. Agent integrates with existing risk management services and monitoring systems

## Story 1.5: AutoGen Multi-Agent Conversation Orchestration

**As a financial professional,**
**I want the three AutoGen agents to engage in structured conversations,**
**so that I receive comprehensive analysis through transparent agent debates.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. AutoGen conversation orchestrator manages structured debates between the three financial agents
2. Conversation flow ensures each agent contributes specialized expertise in logical sequence
3. Agents can respond to and build upon each other's analysis within single conversation
4. Conversation termination logic prevents infinite loops while ensuring thorough analysis
5. Agent debates produce actionable consensus with clear reasoning trail
6. Conversation quality maintained through existing performance monitoring and validation
7. Debates complete within reasonable timeframe (target: 90 seconds) for user experience
8. Agent conversations logged and accessible through existing session management
9. Conversation outcomes integrate with existing consensus calculation and dashboard display
10. Error handling ensures graceful degradation if individual agents fail during conversation
