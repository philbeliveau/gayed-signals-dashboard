# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Clean, professional interface that projects credibility for financial services presentations. The design should feel sophisticated enough for Croesus partnership discussions while remaining intuitive for financial professionals who spend limited time learning new tools. Focus on transparency and clarity to reinforce the "transparent AI reasoning" value proposition.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Real-time conversation streaming**: Users watch agent debates unfold naturally without interruption
- **Content-first workflow**: Simple input → immediate agent analysis → exportable results
- **Professional presentation mode**: Clean export formatting suitable for client meetings
- **Session-based organization**: Multiple concurrent debates with clear session management

## Core Screens and Views
- **Landing/Demo Page**: Professional overview with sample conversation for partnership demonstrations
- **Content Input Screen**: Clean interface for Substack URLs, YouTube links, or direct text paste
- **Live Debate Interface**: Real-time agent conversation display with professional chat-like interface
- **Conversation History**: Session management and previous debate archives
- **Export Dashboard**: PDF generation and formatting options for client presentations
- **User Account/Settings**: Basic authentication and preference management

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Meeting WCAG AA standards to ensure compatibility with enterprise environments and potential regulatory requirements in financial services.

## Branding
Professional financial services aesthetic with clean typography and corporate color scheme. Avoid overly playful or consumer-focused design elements. The interface should reinforce trust and analytical sophistication - think Bloomberg Terminal meets modern SaaS rather than consumer fintech.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Web responsive design optimized for desktop (primary) and tablet (client presentations). Mobile viewing support but not mobile-optimized given the target user workflow of financial professionals conducting analysis during work hours.
