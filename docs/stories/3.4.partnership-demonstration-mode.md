## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **Dashboard UI**: `apps/web/src/components/layout/DashboardHeader.tsx` for demo toggle
- **Authentication**: `apps/web/src/lib/auth/middleware.ts` for secure demo access
- **Help System**: `apps/web/src/components/help/` for guided tour patterns
- **API Infrastructure**: `apps/web/src/app/api/` for integration showcase endpoints
- **Analytics**: Railway built-in metrics and `apps/web/src/lib/analytics/tracking.ts`

### Demo Mode Technical Implementation
- **Demo Toggle**: Feature flag in `apps/web/src/lib/config/feature-flags.ts`
- **Demo State**: Zustand store at `apps/web/src/stores/demoModeStore.ts`
- **Demo Components**: `apps/web/src/components/demo/DemoModeOverlay.tsx`
- **Guided Tour**: Extend existing patterns with `apps/web/src/components/demo/GuidedWalkthrough.tsx`
- **Demo API**: `apps/web/src/app/api/demo-mode/route.ts` for demo-specific features

### Database Schema Requirements
```sql
-- Add to existing schema.prisma
model DemoSession {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId       String?  // Optional for anonymous demo
  sessionType  String   // "guided", "free_explore", "presentation"
  startedAt    DateTime @default(now())
  completedAt  DateTime?
  stepsCompleted Json   // Track walkthrough progress
  engagementData Json   // Analytics for partnership metrics

  // Demo-specific settings
  demoScenario String   // "partnership", "investor", "client"
  customBranding Boolean @default(false)
}
```

### Demo Mode State Management
```typescript
// Zustand store for demo mode
interface DemoModeState {
  isActive: boolean;
  scenario: 'partnership' | 'investor' | 'client';
  currentStep: number;
  walkthroughProgress: {
    agentsIntroduced: boolean;
    conversationTriggered: boolean;
    exportDemonstrated: boolean;
    analyticsShown: boolean;
  };
  customSettings: {
    brandingOverride?: string;
    valuePropsHighlighted: string[];
  };
}
```

### Guided Walkthrough Framework
- **Tour Steps**: Introduction (30s) → Agent Setup (60s) → Live Conversation (90s) → Export Demo (45s) → Analytics (60s)
- **Interactive Elements**: Highlight key features with tooltips and overlays
- **Skip Navigation**: Allow jumping to specific demonstration points
- **Progress Tracking**: Record which features generate most interest

### Partnership Integration Showcase
- **API Examples**: Live documentation with working endpoints
- **WebSocket Demo**: Real-time agent conversation streaming
- **Security Demo**: Authentication flow and data protection
- **Scalability Metrics**: Performance statistics display
- **Integration Scenarios**: Sample webhook configurations and API calls

### Demo Mode Features
```typescript
// Demo mode configuration
interface DemoModeConfig {
  allowAnonymousAccess: boolean;
  enableCustomBranding: boolean;
  showcaseFeatures: {
    agentConversations: boolean;
    signalIntegration: boolean;
    exportCapabilities: boolean;
    analyticsReporting: boolean;
    apiDocumentation: boolean;
  };
  partnershipMetrics: {
    trackEngagement: boolean;
    recordStepCompletion: boolean;
    generateReports: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Key Constraints
- Demo mode must not access or display real user data
- Anonymous demo sessions expire after 2 hours
- Demo data limited to curated sample content
- Performance tracking isolated from production metrics
- Demo mode toggle restricted to admin users or special demo URLs

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Demo mode toggle and interface tests
- Guided walkthrough functionality tests
- Partnership scenario demonstration tests
- Performance metrics and reliability display tests
- Usage tracking and analytics integration tests
