# Story 1.0a: Railway PostgreSQL Service Provisioning

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** system architect,
**I want** PostgreSQL database service provisioned in the existing Railway "Trading-System" project,
**so that** AutoGen conversation data can be persisted and the Python backend can establish database connectivity.

## Foundation Component
**CRITICAL DEPENDENCY**: This story must be completed before any conversation-related functionality (Stories 1.4+). This establishes the foundational data layer for the entire AutoGen system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **RAILWAY SERVICE**: PostgreSQL 15+ service provisioned in existing "Trading-System" Railway project using CLI
2. **DATABASE CREATION**: Database instance operational with connection string available
3. **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**: DATABASE_URL and DIRECT_URL configured in Railway environment
4. **SERVICE CONNECTIVITY**: Database accessible from both local development and Railway deployment
5. **BACKUP CONFIGURATION**: Automated backup schedule configured in Railway dashboard
6. **MONITORING SETUP**: Database metrics integrated with Railway monitoring and alerting
7. **CONNECTION VALIDATION**: Database connection successfully tested from FastAPI backend
8. **SECURITY CONFIGURATION**: SSL/TLS encryption enabled for database connections
9. **RESOURCE ALLOCATION**: Appropriate CPU/memory allocated for conversation workload
10. **DOCUMENTATION**: Railway CLI commands documented for future reference

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Verify Railway CLI access and project connectivity (AC: 1)
  - [x] Authenticate with Railway CLI
  - [x] Link to existing "Trading-System" project
  - [x] Verify project permissions and service creation access
- [x] Provision PostgreSQL database service (AC: 1, 2, 9)
  - [x] Execute `railway add --database postgresql` command
  - [x] Configure PostgreSQL version (15+) and resource allocation
  - [x] Verify database service creation in Railway dashboard
- [x] Configure environment variables and security (AC: 3, 8)
  - [x] Set DATABASE_URL environment variable for all services
  - [x] Set DIRECT_URL for Prisma direct connection
  - [x] Enable SSL/TLS encryption for database connections
- [x] Setup monitoring and backup systems (AC: 5, 6)
  - [x] Configure automated daily backups with 7-day retention
  - [x] Set up database performance monitoring
  - [x] Configure alerting for connection failures and performance issues
- [x] Validate connectivity and document setup (AC: 4, 7, 10)
  - [x] Test database connection from local development environment
  - [x] Test database connection from Railway-deployed backend
  - [x] Document Railway CLI commands and configuration steps

## Dev Notes

### Railway CLI Implementation Commands
```bash
# 1. Authentication and project linking
railway login
railway link trading-system

# 2. List current services to verify state
railway services

# 3. Add PostgreSQL database service
railway add --database postgresql

# 4. Verify service creation
railway services
railway variables

# 5. Set environment variables for all services
railway variables set DATABASE_URL=$DATABASE_URL
railway variables set DIRECT_URL=$DATABASE_URL

# 6. Deploy database service
railway up --service postgresql
```

### Database Configuration Requirements
```yaml
# Railway PostgreSQL Configuration
postgresql:
  version: "15"
  storage: "1GB"
  memory: "512MB"
  backup_schedule: "daily"
  backup_retention: "7 days"
  ssl_mode: "require"
  connection_limit: 100
```

### Environment Variable Setup
```bash
# After database creation, configure for all services
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require"
export DIRECT_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require"

# Set in Railway for web service
railway variables set --service web DATABASE_URL=$DATABASE_URL
railway variables set --service web DIRECT_URL=$DIRECT_URL

# Set in Railway for backend service
railway variables set --service backend DATABASE_URL=$DATABASE_URL
railway variables set --service backend DIRECT_URL=$DIRECT_URL
```

### Connection Testing Approach
```python
# FastAPI backend connection test
# apps/backend/tests/test_database_connection.py
import asyncpg
import os
from core.config import get_settings

async def test_database_connection():
    """Test Railway PostgreSQL connection from FastAPI."""
    settings = get_settings()

    try:
        conn = await asyncpg.connect(settings.database_url)
        result = await conn.fetchval("SELECT version()")
        await conn.close()

        assert "PostgreSQL" in result
        assert "15" in result  # Verify PostgreSQL 15+
        print(f"✅ Database connection successful: {result}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Database connection failed: {str(e)}")
        raise
```

### Key Constraints
- **EXISTING PROJECT**: Must use existing "Trading-System" Railway project without modification
- **CLI APPROACH**: Must use Railway CLI for reproducible infrastructure-as-code
- **SERVICE INTEGRATION**: Must integrate with existing web and backend services
- **ENVIRONMENT PARITY**: Local development and production must use identical connection patterns
- **SECURITY FIRST**: SSL/TLS encryption required for all database connections
- **MONITORING READY**: Must support existing monitoring and alerting infrastructure

### Resource Planning
**Development Phase:**
- Storage: 1GB (sufficient for conversation data and testing)
- Memory: 512MB (handles concurrent connections)
- Connection Limit: 100 (supports development and testing load)

**Production Scaling (Future):**
- Storage: Auto-scaling based on conversation volume
- Memory: 1-2GB for production workload
- Connection pooling via Prisma for optimal performance

## Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-09-28 | 1.0 | Database infrastructure foundation story created | SPARC Orchestrator |

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: Railway CLI access and "Trading-System" project permissions
- **Blocks**: Story 1.0b (Core Database Schema & Migration Setup)
- **Enables**: All conversation-dependent stories (1.4+)

## Risk Assessment
**Primary Risk**: Railway service provisioning failure or connection issues
**Mitigation**: Validate Railway CLI access before execution, test connection immediately after creation
**Rollback Plan**: `railway service delete postgresql` and environment variable cleanup

## Testing Strategy
**Infrastructure Testing:**
- Railway CLI command execution validation
- Database service creation verification
- Environment variable configuration testing
- SSL/TLS connection security validation

**Integration Testing:**
- FastAPI backend connection testing
- Next.js environment variable access
- Cross-service connectivity validation
- Local development environment parity testing

**Monitoring Validation:**
- Railway dashboard database metrics verification
- Backup schedule and retention testing
- Alert configuration and notification testing
