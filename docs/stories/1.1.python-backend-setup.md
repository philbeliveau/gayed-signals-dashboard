# Story 1.1: python-backend-setup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** system architect,
**I want** Python backend infrastructure established with FastAPI integration,
**so that** AutoGen framework can be deployed alongside existing Next.js application with proper API communication.

## Foundation Component
**PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT ENABLED**: This story can start immediately without dependencies, enabling parallel work on AutoGen while maintaining existing architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **PYTHON BACKEND**: FastAPI server running on Railway alongside existing Next.js application
2. **API COMMUNICATION**: Next.js ↔ FastAPI communication bridge established with existing authentication
3. **DEPLOYMENT**: Python backend deployed on Railway with environment variable configuration
4. **HEALTH MONITORING**: FastAPI health checks integrated with existing Railway monitoring
5. **AUTHENTICATION**: FastAPI endpoints secured with existing Clerk authentication patterns
6. **ERROR HANDLING**: Python backend error handling integrated with existing monitoring and logging
7. **CORS CONFIGURATION**: FastAPI CORS properly configured for Next.js frontend communication
8. **DATABASE ACCESS**: Python backend connected to existing PostgreSQL database
9. **SHARED UTILITIES**: Common utilities accessible from both Next.js and FastAPI applications
10. **TESTING FRAMEWORK**: Python testing setup with pytest and integration test patterns

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Set up FastAPI server infrastructure (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Create `apps/backend/` directory structure
  - [x] Install FastAPI with Railway deployment configuration
  - [x] Configure environment variables and secrets
- [x] Establish API communication bridge (AC: 2, 7)
  - [x] Create Next.js ↔ FastAPI communication layer
  - [x] Configure CORS for cross-application requests
- [x] Integrate authentication and monitoring (AC: 4, 5, 6)
  - [x] Connect Clerk authentication to FastAPI endpoints
  - [x] Set up health checks and error handling
  - [x] Integrate with existing monitoring systems
- [x] Database and utilities integration (AC: 8, 9, 10)
  - [x] Connect Python backend to PostgreSQL
  - [x] Create shared utility functions
  - [x] Set up pytest testing framework

## Dev Notes

### Railway Deployment Architecture
```yaml
services:
  web:
    name: "gayed-signals-web"
    framework: "Next.js"
    build:
      builder: "nixpacks"
      buildCommand: "npm run build"

  backend:
    name: "gayed-signals-backend"
    framework: "Python"
    build:
      builder: "nixpacks"
      buildCommand: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    startCommand: "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
```

### FastAPI Application Structure
```
apps/backend/
├── main.py                 # FastAPI application entry point
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies

```

### API Communication Pattern
```typescript
// Next.js API client for FastAPI communication
// apps/web/src/lib/api/backend-client.ts
export class BackendApiClient {
  private baseUrl = process.env.BACKEND_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';

  async healthCheck(): Promise<HealthStatus> {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/health`, {
      headers: await this.getAuthHeaders()
    });
    return response.json();
  }

  private async getAuthHeaders() {
    // Integrate with existing Clerk authentication
    const token = await getToken();
    return {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    };
  }
}
```

### Key Constraints
- **NO EXISTING SYSTEM CHANGES**: Must not modify existing Next.js application
- **RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT**: Must work within Railway's container limitations
- **AUTHENTICATION**: Must use existing Clerk patterns without modification
- **DATABASE**: Must share existing PostgreSQL without schema changes
- **MONITORING**: Must integrate with existing Railway monitoring

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- FastAPI application startup and health check tests
- Next.js ↔ FastAPI communication tests
- Authentication middleware integration tests
- Database connection and shared utility tests
- Railway deployment and environment configuration tests

### Review Date: 2025-09-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation demonstrating professional software engineering practices. The AutoGen backend infrastructure is well-architected with clean FastAPI design patterns, comprehensive error handling, and robust testing strategies. The graceful fallback pattern for AutoGen dependencies allows seamless development without external dependencies while maintaining production readiness.

### Refactoring Performed

**Pydantic Configuration Modernization (Post-Review Improvement):**

- **File**: `apps/backend/core/config.py`
  - **Change**: Updated from deprecated `Config` class to modern `ConfigDict` pattern
  - **Why**: Resolve Pydantic deprecation warnings and future-proof the configuration
  - **How**: Replaced `class Config:` with `model_config = ConfigDict()` and removed deprecated `env=` field parameters

- **File**: `apps/backend/models/conversation_models.py`
  - **Change**: Updated all Pydantic models to use `ConfigDict` and removed deprecated `json_encoders`
  - **Why**: Eliminate deprecation warnings and align with Pydantic V2 best practices
  - **How**: Replaced all `class Config:` with `model_config = ConfigDict()`

- **Files**: `apps/backend/api/routes/prompts.py`, `economic_data.py`, `videos.py`, `folders.py`
  - **Change**: Updated `@validator` to `@field_validator` with modern syntax
  - **Why**: Use current Pydantic V2 validation patterns
  - **How**: Added `@classmethod` decorator and updated function signatures to use `info` parameter

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Python/TypeScript standards with proper naming and organization
- Project Structure: ✓ Maintains monorepo structure with domain separation
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive pytest and vitest coverage with proper mocking
