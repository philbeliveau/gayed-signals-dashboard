# Implement VIX Defensive Signal - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **trader using the Gayed signals system**,
I want **the VIX Defensive signal to be implemented and functional**,
So that **I have access to comprehensive volatility analysis as part of the complete signal suite**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Signal orchestrator and engines directory at `src/domains/trading-signals/engines/`
- Technology: TypeScript signal calculation classes following existing engine patterns
- Follows pattern: Existing signal engines with VIX data analysis capabilities
- Touch points: Signal orchestrator configuration, VIX data pipeline, signal calculation flow

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. VIX defensive signal calculates correctly using proper volatility analysis algorithm
2. Signal integrates seamlessly with existing signal orchestrator
3. Full test coverage and validation for all VIX scenarios

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing signal calculations continue to work unchanged
5. New signal follows existing engine class patterns and interfaces
6. Integration with orchestrator maintains current signal processing behavior

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Change is covered by comprehensive unit tests
8. VIX signal calculation documentation is complete
9. No regression in existing signal functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Create `vix-defensive.ts` in engines directory following existing signal engine patterns
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Existing signal engine implementations for data analysis and calculation
- **Key Constraints:** Must handle VIX volatility data accurately and maintain performance standards

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** VIX data interpretation errors affecting defensive signal accuracy
- **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive VIX scenario testing and validation
- **Rollback:** Disable signal in orchestrator if calculation issues arise

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible
