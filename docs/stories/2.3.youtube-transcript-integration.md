### AutoGen Integration Architecture
**TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:**
- **AutoGen Framework**: Microsoft AutoGen 0.2+ integrated with existing Python FastAPI backend
- **Agent Implementation**: Convert existing financial agents to AutoGen ConversableAgent classes
- **Communication Pattern**: AutoGen GroupChat for Financial Analyst → Market Context → Risk Challenger
- **Integration Point**: `/backend/api/routes/simple_youtube.py` → AutoGen conversation → WebSocket stream
- **Transcript Processing**: yt-dlp + Whisper API → AutoGen message format + Gayed signal context
- **Response Format**: AutoGen conversation history + video metadata → Dashboard real-time display

**Python AutoGen Implementation:**
```python
from autogen import ConversableAgent, GroupChat, GroupChatManager

# Convert existing agents to AutoGen
financial_analyst = ConversableAgent(
    name="FinancialAnalyst",
    system_message="Analyze video content with current Gayed signals context",
    llm_config={"model": "gpt-4-turbo", "api_key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")}
)

# GroupChat coordination
groupchat = GroupChat(
    agents=[financial_analyst, market_context, risk_challenger],
    messages=[],
    max_round=6,
    speaker_selection_method="round_robin"
)

# Conversation with video + signal context
conversation_result = await groupchat_manager.initiate_chat(
    message=f"Video Analysis: {transcript}\nCurrent Signals: {gayed_signals}"
)
```

### YouTube Integration Enhancement
Enhance existing capabilities to:
- Trigger AutoGen financial agent debates from video content
- Maintain current transcript extraction quality
- Preserve existing performance and caching benefits
- Integrate video analysis with signal context

### Content Optimization for AutoGen
Transcript content should be:
- Formatted for optimal agent analysis
- Combined with video metadata for context
- Validated for financial relevance
- Prepared with current signal context

### Technical Constraints & Error Handling
**System Constraints:**
- Preserve existing `/src/shared/lib/api/video-insights.ts` functionality
- Maintain compatibility with current Next.js API fallback routes
- FastAPI backend required for yt-dlp and Whisper API integration
- PostgreSQL storage for transcript caching and conversation history

**Error Handling & Fallback Mechanisms:**
```typescript
interface YouTubeProcessingError {
  code: 'VIDEO_UNAVAILABLE' | 'TRANSCRIPT_FAILED' | 'AUTOGEN_TIMEOUT' | 'RATE_LIMITED';
  message: string;
  fallbackAction: 'RETRY_LATER' | 'USE_CACHED' | 'MANUAL_REVIEW';
  retryAfter?: number;
}

// Graceful degradation strategy
const fallbackStrategies = {
  transcriptFailed: () => 'Use video title and description for basic analysis',
  autoGenTimeout: () => 'Return transcript with relevance score only',
  rateLimited: () => 'Queue for processing when limits reset'
};
```

**Security & Rate Limiting:**
- YouTube API quota management: 10,000 units/day allocation
- User rate limits: 3 videos/hour per user, 20 videos/day total
- Content validation: Financial relevance filtering before AutoGen trigger
- Input sanitization: URL validation, malicious link detection

### Performance Requirements & Monitoring
**Performance Specifications:**
- Video transcript extraction: <60s for 20-minute videos
- AutoGen conversation: <45s for 6-round agent debate
- Memory usage: <1GB for video processing, <500MB for conversation
- Concurrent processing: Support 5 simultaneous video analyses

**Monitoring & Metrics:**
- Real-time dashboards: Processing time, success rate, error categorization
- Resource monitoring: CPU usage, memory consumption, API rate limits
- Quality metrics: Transcript accuracy, financial relevance scores
- Alert thresholds: >90s processing time, >10% error rate, memory >80%

### Testing Framework
**Comprehensive Testing Strategy:**
- **Unit Tests**: Mock yt-dlp, Whisper API, AutoGen agents with pytest
- **Integration Tests**: Real YouTube URLs with mock AutoGen conversations
- **Performance Tests**: 10 concurrent videos, memory leak detection
- **Error Handling**: Invalid URLs, private videos, rate limiting scenarios
- **End-to-End**: YouTube URL → Transcript → Mock AutoGen → Dashboard display

**AutoGen Testing Implementation:**
```python
# Mock AutoGen for testing
@pytest.fixture
def mock_autogen_conversation():
    return {
        "messages": [
            {"agent": "FinancialAnalyst", "content": "Video shows bullish indicators..."},
            {"agent": "MarketContext", "content": "Current VIX suggests caution..."},
            {"agent": "RiskChallenger", "content": "Historical data contradicts..."}
        ],
        "consensus": "Mixed signals - proceed with caution",
        "confidence_score": 75
    }
```
