# Story 1.7: risk-challenger-agent

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** risk-conscious investor,
**I want** a Risk Challenger AutoGen agent that systematically questions analysis,
**so that** I understand potential downsides and alternative interpretations of signals.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Risk Challenger agent provides systematic adversarial analysis of other agents' conclusions
2. Agent has access to existing backtesting data from `src/domains/backtesting/engines/`
3. Agent can reference historical signal failure cases using existing performance metrics
4. Agent challenges assumptions using existing risk management utilities and validation
5. Agent provides contrarian viewpoints and stress testing scenarios
6. Agent identifies potential failure modes using existing Monte Carlo and bootstrap analysis
7. Agent questions market timing and signal reliability using historical data
8. Agent maintains professional skepticism while providing constructive alternative analysis
9. Agent responses include specific historical examples and statistical evidence
10. Agent integrates with existing risk management services and monitoring systems

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement adversarial analysis capabilities (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Design systematic questioning framework
  - [ ] Implement contrarian viewpoint generation
- [ ] Connect to backtesting and historical data (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Integrate with Monte Carlo engine (`src/domains/backtesting/engines/monte-carlo.ts`)
  - [ ] Integrate with Bootstrap engine (`src/domains/backtesting/engines/bootstrap.ts`)
  - [ ] Access historical signal failure cases and performance metrics
- [ ] Integrate risk management systems (AC: 4, 6)
  - [ ] Connect to SAFLA validator (`src/domains/risk-management/utils/safla-validator.ts`)
  - [ ] Access Monte Carlo stress testing and scenario analysis
  - [ ] Utilize bootstrap confidence interval analysis for historical reliability
- [ ] Develop historical analysis capabilities (AC: 7, 9)
  - [ ] Market timing analysis using historical data
  - [ ] Historical example and statistical evidence inclusion
- [ ] Maintain professional approach (AC: 8, 10)
  - [ ] Design constructive skepticism personality
  - [ ] Integrate with existing risk monitoring systems

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- `src/domains/backtesting/engines/monte-carlo.ts` - Monte Carlo simulation engine
- `src/domains/backtesting/engines/bootstrap.ts` - Bootstrap methods engine
- `src/domains/backtesting/metrics/performance.ts` - Performance metrics
- `src/domains/risk-management/utils/safla-validator.ts` - SAFLA validation system
- `src/domains/risk-management/services/risk-manager.ts` - Risk management services

### Risk Analysis Approach
Risk Challenger agent should provide:
- Systematic adversarial analysis of conclusions
- Historical context for potential failure modes
- Stress testing scenarios and contrarian viewpoints
- Statistical evidence and specific historical examples
- Professional skepticism balanced with constructive feedback

### Agent Personality Design
- Professional skepticism without being destructive
- Constructive alternative analysis
- Evidence-based challenges using historical data
- Systematic approach to questioning assumptions

### Key Constraints
- Must access existing backtesting and risk systems without modification
- Should enhance decision-making through constructive challenge
- Must maintain professional tone suitable for investment discussions
- Statistical evidence and historical examples required for credibility
- **CRITICAL**: No synthetic or fallback data - maintain financial-grade integrity
- Agent must state when historical data is insufficient rather than fabricating examples

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Integration tests with backtesting engines and risk systems
- Historical data access and analysis accuracy tests
- Agent personality and response quality validation
- End-to-end tests for risk analysis conversations
- Performance tests for historical data processing
