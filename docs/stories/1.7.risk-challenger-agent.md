## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- `src/domains/backtesting/engines/monte-carlo.ts` - Monte Carlo simulation engine
- `src/domains/backtesting/engines/bootstrap.ts` - Bootstrap methods engine
- `src/domains/backtesting/metrics/performance.ts` - Performance metrics
- `src/domains/risk-management/utils/safla-validator.ts` - SAFLA validation system
- `src/domains/risk-management/services/risk-manager.ts` - Risk management services

### Risk Analysis Approach
Risk Challenger agent should provide:
- Systematic adversarial analysis of conclusions
- Historical context for potential failure modes
- Stress testing scenarios and contrarian viewpoints
- Statistical evidence and specific historical examples
- Professional skepticism balanced with constructive feedback

### Agent Personality Design
- Professional skepticism without being destructive
- Constructive alternative analysis
- Evidence-based challenges using historical data
- Systematic approach to questioning assumptions

### Key Constraints
- Must access existing backtesting and risk systems without modification
- Should enhance decision-making through constructive challenge
- Must maintain professional tone suitable for investment discussions
- Statistical evidence and historical examples required for credibility
- **CRITICAL**: No synthetic or fallback data - maintain financial-grade integrity
- Agent must state when historical data is insufficient rather than fabricating examples

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Integration tests with backtesting engines and risk systems
- Historical data access and analysis accuracy tests
- Agent personality and response quality validation
- End-to-end tests for risk analysis conversations
- Performance tests for historical data processing

### Completion Notes
✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - Risk Challenger agent successfully implemented with full integration to existing backtesting and risk management systems.

**Key Achievements:**
- **Systematic Adversarial Analysis**: Implemented comprehensive questioning framework with assumption challenges, timing risks, and contrarian viewpoint generation
- **Monte Carlo Integration**: Connected to existing Monte Carlo engine for stress testing with 1000 simulations and multiple scenario types (market crash, bear market, fat tail returns)
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Integrated with Bootstrap engine for confidence interval analysis and robustness metrics (consistency, stability, reliability)
- **SAFLA Compliance**: Full integration with SAFLA validator ensuring 100% real data usage with no synthetic fallbacks
- **Historical Analysis**: Implemented historical failure analysis across crisis periods (2007-2009, 2020, 2000-2002) with failure mode identification
- **Professional Skepticism**: Designed constructive challenge personality with evidence-based refutation and alternative scenario generation
- **MCP Integration**: Connected to Perplexity, Web Search, and Trader MCP services for contrarian research
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 30 test cases covering all functionality with 100% pass rate

**Technical Implementation:**
- Core agent: `apps/web/src/domains/ai-agents/agents/agents/risk-challenger-agent.ts`
- Test suite: `apps/web/src/domains/ai-agents/agents/agents/__tests__/risk-challenger-agent.test.ts`
- Agent factory integration: Updated `index.ts` with RISK_CHALLENGER type
- MCP Requirements: Perplexity, Web Search, Trader (reuses existing services)

**Risk Analysis Capabilities:**
1. **Assumption Challenges**: Extracts and questions key assumptions using pattern matching
2. **Market Timing Risks**: Identifies timing dependencies and historical timing failures
3. **Contrarian Scenarios**: Generates alternative interpretations (bear vs bull, volatility vs stability)
4. **Stress Testing**: Monte Carlo simulations with market crash and fat tail scenarios
5. **Confidence Analysis**: Bootstrap resampling for robustness and reliability metrics
6. **Historical Precedents**: Analysis of similar patterns in crisis periods with lessons learned

**SAFLA Data Integrity Maintained:**
- No synthetic data generation - explicit warning when data unavailable
- Real-time market data validation through existing SAFLA protocols
- Comprehensive audit trail for all external service calls
- Graceful degradation without fallback data fabrication

### Debug Log References
- All 30 test cases pass successfully
- No linting errors introduced (existing warnings in other files preserved)
- Integration tests validate Monte Carlo and Bootstrap engine connectivity
- SAFLA compliance verified throughout investigation workflows
