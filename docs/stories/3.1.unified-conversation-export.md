# Story 3.1: unified-conversation-export

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** financial professional,
**I want** to export agent conversation transcripts in multiple professional formats,
**so that** I can share transparent AI reasoning with clients and partners for presentations and compliance documentation.

5. **AUTHENTICATION INTEGRATION**: Respects existing Clerk authentication and session management
6. **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZED**: Handles large conversation transcripts efficiently with existing monitoring
7. **COMPLIANCE READY**: Data privacy, security requirements, and audit trails for regulatory needs
8. **PARTNERSHIP FEATURES**: White-label export options, custom branding, API integration examples
