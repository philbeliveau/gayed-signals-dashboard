# Story 3.1: unified-conversation-export

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** financial professional,
**I want** to export agent conversation transcripts in multiple professional formats,
**so that** I can share transparent AI reasoning with clients and partners for presentations and compliance documentation.

3. **PROFESSIONAL FORMATTING**: Financial services document standards with existing branding and typography
4. **COMPREHENSIVE CONTEXT**: Include signal context, market data, timestamps, agent analysis summary, and key insights
5. **AUTHENTICATION INTEGRATION**: Respects existing Clerk authentication and session management
6. **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZED**: Handles large conversation transcripts efficiently with existing monitoring
7. **COMPLIANCE READY**: Data privacy, security requirements, and audit trails for regulatory needs
8. **PARTNERSHIP FEATURES**: White-label export options, custom branding, API integration examples
9. **CLIENT COMMUNICATION**: Optimized formatting for financial advisory presentations and compliance documentation
10. **USAGE TRACKING**: Integrated monitoring, analytics, and usage tracking for both internal and partnership metrics
