# Story 2.7: conversation-state-management

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** agent conversation state synchronized with existing dashboard state,
**so that** live debates integrate seamlessly with current signal display and user workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Conversation state management extends existing dashboard state patterns and context management
2. Real-time agent messages synchronized with existing signal data and market context display
3. Conversation state persists using existing session management and local storage patterns
4. Agent debate state integrates with existing dashboard navigation and routing
5. Conversation history accessible through existing session management and data persistence
6. Real-time state updates maintain existing dashboard performance and responsiveness
7. Agent conversation state respects existing user preferences and customization settings
8. Conversation management integrates with existing error handling and recovery mechanisms
9. Live debate state synchronized across multiple browser tabs using existing state patterns
10. Conversation state cleanup uses existing session lifecycle and resource management

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Extend dashboard state management (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Extend existing state patterns for conversation data
  - [ ] Synchronize agent messages with signal and market data
- [ ] Implement state persistence (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Use existing session management for conversation state
  - [ ] Make conversation history accessible through existing patterns
- [ ] Integrate with navigation and routing (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Connect agent debate state with dashboard navigation
  - [ ] Ensure routing compatibility with live conversations
- [ ] Maintain performance and preferences (AC: 6, 7)
  - [ ] Keep existing dashboard performance standards
  - [ ] Respect existing user preferences and customization
- [ ] Add error handling and cleanup (AC: 8, 9, 10)
  - [ ] Integrate with existing error handling mechanisms
  - [ ] Synchronize state across browser tabs
  - [ ] Use existing session lifecycle for cleanup

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Existing dashboard state patterns and context management
- Session management and local storage systems
- Dashboard navigation and routing infrastructure
- User preferences and customization settings

### State Management Approach
- Extend existing dashboard state patterns rather than creating new ones
- Synchronize conversation state with current signal and market data
- Maintain state persistence using existing session management
- Integrate seamlessly with current navigation and user workflow

### Performance Considerations
- Real-time state updates must not impact dashboard performance
- State synchronization across tabs using existing patterns
- Efficient conversation history management
- Proper state cleanup and resource management

### Key Constraints
- Must extend existing state patterns, not replace them
- Cannot impact existing dashboard performance
- State management must respect current user preferences
- Integration with existing error handling and recovery required

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- State management integration tests
- Real-time synchronization performance tests
- Multi-tab state synchronization tests
- Session persistence and cleanup tests
- Error handling and recovery tests
