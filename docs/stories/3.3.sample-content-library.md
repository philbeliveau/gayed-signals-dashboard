## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **Dashboard Navigation**: `apps/web/src/components/layout/NavigationSidebar.tsx`
- **UI Patterns**: `apps/web/src/components/ui/` for consistent component styling
- **Authentication**: `apps/web/src/lib/auth/middleware.ts` for user management
- **Agent Integration**: `apps/backend/src/agents/` for AutoGen trigger systems
- **Monitoring**: Railway metrics and `apps/web/src/lib/analytics/` patterns

### Content Management Technical Implementation
- **Content Storage**: PostgreSQL with new `DemoContent` table in `apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Content API**: `apps/web/src/app/api/demo-content/route.ts`
- **Library Component**: `apps/web/src/components/demo/SampleContentLibrary.tsx`
- **Content Admin**: `apps/web/src/app/admin/demo-content/page.tsx` for content management
- **File Storage**: Railway Volume Storage for uploaded sample files

### Database Schema Requirements
```sql
-- Add to existing schema.prisma
model DemoContent {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  title       String
  description String
  contentType String   // "substack", "youtube", "text", "article"
  content     String   // URL or direct content
  scenario    String   // "bull", "bear", "volatile", "mixed"
  agentTrigger Json    // Configuration for which agents to trigger
  isActive    Boolean  @default(true)
  priority    Int      @default(0) // Display order
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  // Track usage for analytics
  usageCount  Int      @default(0)
  lastUsed    DateTime?
}
```

### Content Curation Strategy
- **Market Scenarios**: Bull (30%), Bear (30%), Volatile (25%), Mixed (15%)
- **Content Sources**: Curated Substack articles, YouTube transcripts, market commentary
- **Refresh Schedule**: Weekly content review, monthly full refresh
- **Quality Control**: Financial advisor review before content activation

### Partnership Demo Features
- **Content Categories**: Navigation by market scenario and content type
- **Preview Mode**: Show expected agent debate outcomes
- **Explanation Cards**: Partnership value proposition for each sample
- **Usage Analytics**: Track which content resonates in demonstrations

### Content Management System
```typescript
// Content management interface
interface DemoContentConfig {
  refreshSchedule: 'weekly' | 'monthly';
  scenarioDistribution: {
    bull: number;
    bear: number;
    volatile: number;
    mixed: number;
  };
  qualityReviewRequired: boolean;
  autoArchiveAfter: number; // days
}
```

### Key Constraints
- Content review by financial professionals required before activation
- Maximum 50 active demo pieces to maintain quality and performance
- Content must comply with financial compliance standards
- Automatic archiving of content older than 90 days
- Rate limiting: Demo content triggers limited to 10 per hour per session

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Demo library interface integration tests
- Sample content and AutoGen trigger tests
- Partnership demonstration workflow tests
- Content refresh and management tests
- Performance monitoring integration tests
