# Remove Hardcoded API Credentials - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **trading platform operator**,
I want **all API credentials removed from source code and properly managed through environment variables**,
So that **the platform maintains security compliance and prevents credential exposure risks**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Trading API endpoint at `src/app/api/signals/route.ts`
- Technology: Next.js API routes with environment variable configuration
- Follows pattern: Standard environment-based configuration management
- Touch points: Lines 76-77 and 186-187 in route.ts, deployment configuration

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. All hardcoded API credentials removed from source files
2. Environment variable validation implemented with fail-fast behavior
3. Proper credential loading from environment configuration

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing API functionality continues to work unchanged
5. New credential management follows existing environment pattern
6. Integration with deployment pipeline maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Change is covered by environment validation tests
8. Security documentation is updated with new credential management
9. No regression in API functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Replace hardcoded credentials in route.ts with environment variable lookups
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow Next.js environment variable pattern used elsewhere in codebase
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain API compatibility and response times

## Definition of Done

- [x] Functional requirements met
- [x] Integration requirements verified
- [x] Existing functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** API failures if environment variables not properly configured
- **Mitigation:** Implement validation with clear error messages and deployment checks
- **Rollback:** Revert to previous version with proper environment configuration

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [x] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [x] Performance impact is negligible
