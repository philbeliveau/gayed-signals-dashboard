# Real-Time Data Validation System - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **trading platform operator**,
I want **comprehensive real-time data validation with market hours awareness**,
So that **all trading decisions are based on validated, fresh data appropriate for current market conditions**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Market data services and validation pipeline infrastructure
- Technology: TypeScript validation services with market hours detection and real-time monitoring
- Follows pattern: Existing data validation and market data service patterns
- Touch points: Market data client, validation pipeline, trading halt mechanisms, market hours logic

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Data freshness validation ensures data is less than 15 minutes old during market hours
2. Market hours awareness system adjusts validation rules based on trading schedule
3. Data source consistency checks validate data integrity across sources
4. Automatic trading halt mechanisms trigger on validation failures

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Existing market data functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New validation system follows existing data service patterns
7. Integration with trading pipeline maintains current operational flow

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Change is covered by comprehensive validation scenario tests
9. Market hours and validation documentation is complete
10. No regression in existing data processing verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Create market data validator service with market hours detection and validation rules
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Current market data services and validation infrastructure
- **Key Constraints:** Must validate data without impacting trading performance during market hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Overly strict validation blocking legitimate trading during market volatility
- **Mitigation:** Implement configurable validation thresholds and comprehensive market scenario testing
- **Rollback:** Disable validation mechanisms if legitimate trading is blocked

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is monitored and acceptable
