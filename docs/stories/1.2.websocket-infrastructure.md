# Story 1.2: websocket-infrastructure

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** WebSocket server capability integrated with current API infrastructure,
**so that** AutoGen agent conversations can be streamed live to the existing dashboard.

## Infrastructure Dependency Note
**MOVED**: This story moved from Epic 3 to Epic 1 because WebSocket infrastructure is required by Story 1.5 (Multi-Agent Orchestrator) for real-time conversation streaming. This enables parallel development in Epic 3.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **GENERIC EVENT SYSTEM**: WebSocket infrastructure designed for generic events (not AutoGen-specific)
2. **DUAL DEPLOYMENT**: WebSocket server works with both Next.js and Python backend applications
3. **AUTHENTICATION BRIDGE**: Clerk authentication works seamlessly across WebSocket connections
4. **EVENT PUBLISHING**: Event-driven architecture allowing both Next.js and Python to publish events
5. **SUBSCRIPTION MANAGEMENT**: Clients can subscribe to specific event channels (conversations, signals, etc.)
6. **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZED**: Handles concurrent connections with existing monitoring integration
7. **ERROR HANDLING**: Graceful connection management with automatic reconnection capabilities
8. **SECURITY COMPLIANT**: Maintains existing CORS and authentication requirements
9. **SCALABLE ARCHITECTURE**: Compatible with Railway deployment and auto-scaling
10. **LOOSE COUPLING**: WebSocket infrastructure independent of specific service implementations
