# Story 1.2: websocket-infrastructure

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** WebSocket server capability integrated with current API infrastructure,
**so that** AutoGen agent conversations can be streamed live to the existing dashboard.

## Infrastructure Dependency Note
**MOVED**: This story moved from Epic 3 to Epic 1 because WebSocket infrastructure is required by Story 1.5 (Multi-Agent Orchestrator) for real-time conversation streaming. This enables parallel development in Epic 3.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **GENERIC EVENT SYSTEM**: WebSocket infrastructure designed for generic events (not AutoGen-specific)
2. **DUAL DEPLOYMENT**: WebSocket server works with both Next.js and Python backend applications
3. **AUTHENTICATION BRIDGE**: Clerk authentication works seamlessly across WebSocket connections
4. **EVENT PUBLISHING**: Event-driven architecture allowing both Next.js and Python to publish events
5. **SUBSCRIPTION MANAGEMENT**: Clients can subscribe to specific event channels (conversations, signals, etc.)
6. **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZED**: Handles concurrent connections with existing monitoring integration
7. **ERROR HANDLING**: Graceful connection management with automatic reconnection capabilities
8. **SECURITY COMPLIANT**: Maintains existing CORS and authentication requirements
9. **SCALABLE ARCHITECTURE**: Compatible with Railway deployment and auto-scaling
10. **LOOSE COUPLING**: WebSocket infrastructure independent of specific service implementations

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement WebSocket server (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Add Socket.io server using existing API patterns
  - [ ] Integrate Clerk authentication for WebSocket connections
- [ ] Add connection management (AC: 3, 6)
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting for WebSocket connections
  - [ ] Handle multiple concurrent users with existing patterns
- [ ] Integrate with existing systems (AC: 4, 5)
  - [ ] Connect to existing error handling and logging
  - [ ] Integrate with PostgreSQL and caching systems
- [ ] Implement security and monitoring (AC: 7, 8)
  - [ ] Maintain existing CORS and authentication requirements
  - [ ] Integrate with existing monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Ensure deployment compatibility (AC: 9, 10)
  - [ ] Make compatible with existing hosting setup
  - [ ] Use existing session cleanup and resource management

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- `/app/api/` - Existing API structure patterns to follow
- Clerk authentication and session management systems
- Rate limiting and performance monitoring infrastructure
- PostgreSQL and caching systems for state management

### WebSocket Implementation Approach
- Use Socket.io for reliable real-time communication
- Integrate seamlessly with existing API infrastructure
- Maintain existing authentication and security patterns
- Leverage current monitoring and error handling capabilities

### Connection Management Design
- Handle multiple concurrent users efficiently
- Respect existing rate limiting constraints
- Use existing session management for connection state
- Implement proper connection cleanup and resource management

### Key Constraints
- Must follow existing API patterns exactly
- Cannot compromise existing authentication or security
- Must respect current rate limiting and performance constraints
- Integration with existing monitoring and health check systems required

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- WebSocket connection and authentication tests
- Multiple concurrent user connection tests
- Rate limiting and performance constraint tests
- Integration tests with existing systems
- Security and CORS compliance tests
