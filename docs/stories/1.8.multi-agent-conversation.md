# Story 1.8: multi-agent-conversation

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** financial professional,
**I want** the three AutoGen agents to engage in structured conversations,
**so that** I receive comprehensive analysis through transparent agent debates.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AutoGen conversation orchestrator manages structured debates between the three financial agents
2. Conversation flow ensures each agent contributes specialized expertise in logical sequence
3. Agents can respond to and build upon each other's analysis within single conversation
4. Conversation termination logic prevents infinite loops while ensuring thorough analysis
5. Agent debates produce actionable consensus with clear reasoning trail
6. Conversation quality maintained through existing performance monitoring and validation
7. Debates complete within reasonable timeframe (target: 90 seconds) for user experience
8. Agent conversations logged and accessible through existing session management
9. Conversation outcomes integrate with existing consensus calculation and dashboard display
10. Error handling ensures graceful degradation if individual agents fail during conversation

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- `src/domains/trading-signals/engines/orchestrator.ts` - Signal orchestration (REFERENCE, not extend)
- New: AutoGen conversation orchestrator (separate implementation)
- Session management and logging systems (existing)
- Performance monitoring infrastructure (existing)
- Dashboard display components for conversation results (existing/enhanced)

### Conversation Flow Design
Structured debate flow should:
1. Financial Analyst provides quantitative analysis
2. Market Context agent adds economic context
3. Risk Challenger questions and provides alternatives
4. Iterative refinement based on cross-agent feedback
5. Consensus generation with clear reasoning trail

### Performance Requirements
- Target: 90-second completion for user experience
- Conversation quality maintained through monitoring
- Graceful degradation if agents fail
- Efficient context sharing between agents

### Integration Approach
Leverage existing orchestration patterns while adding AutoGen-specific conversation management. Must integrate seamlessly with current dashboard and session systems.

**EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE: Breaking Circular Dependencies**
1. **Signal Orchestration** (`SignalOrchestrator`): Coordinates Gayed signal calculations
   - Handles quantitative signal aggregation (utilities/SPY, lumber/gold, etc.)
   - Produces numerical consensus (Risk-On/Risk-Off/Mixed)
   - PRESERVED AS-IS - no modification

2. **Agent Conversation Orchestration** (NEW): Event-driven AutoGen coordination
   - **SUBSCRIBES** to "content_ready" events from content processing
   - **PUBLISHES** "conversation_started", "agent_message", "conversation_complete" events
   - **REACTIVE PATTERN**: No direct dependencies on content processing systems
   - Built using AutoGen conversation management patterns
   - Consumes signal orchestrator results as input

**Event-Driven Architecture Pattern:**
```
Content Processing → "content_ready" event → Event Bus → AutoGen Orchestrator
                                                            ↓
SignalOrchestrator → Quantitative Data → Event Payload → Agent Conversations
                                                            ↓
WebSocket Events ← "agent_message" events ← Event Bus ← Conversation Results
       ↓
   Dashboard Display (Real-time updates)
```

### Key Constraints
- Must complete within 90 seconds for good UX
- Conversation quality must be maintained
- Error handling for individual agent failures
- Integration with existing consensus and dashboard systems
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT modify existing SignalOrchestrator - create separate system
- Agent conversations consume signal data but produce separate reasoning consensus
- Two consensus types: Signal consensus (quantitative) + Agent consensus (qualitative)
- Maintain financial-grade data integrity - no fallback data in agent conversations

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- End-to-end conversation flow tests with all three agents
- Performance tests for 90-second completion target
- Error handling and graceful degradation tests
- Integration tests with existing SignalOrchestrator (READ-ONLY access)
- Conversation quality and consensus generation validation
- **Separation tests**: Verify signal orchestration unaffected by agent conversations
- **Dual consensus tests**: Validate both signal + agent consensus display correctly

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL DATABASE CONNECTIVITY ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED**

The multi-agent conversation system was implemented without proper Railway database connectivity for conversation persistence. The system was using in-memory storage only, which would cause data loss on service restarts and prevent conversation history tracking.

**Key Findings:**
1. ✅ **Railway Database Connection**: Fixed DATABASE_URL format conversion from `postgresql://` to `postgresql+asyncpg://` for async operations
2. ✅ **SSL Configuration**: Resolved `sslmode=require` to `ssl=require` parameter conversion for asyncpg compatibility
3. ✅ **Database Models**: Added missing SQLAlchemy models for conversation persistence (`ConversationSession`, `ConversationMessage`)
4. ✅ **API Integration**: Integrated database session dependency injection into conversation endpoints
5. ✅ **Full Persistence**: Implemented conversation session, message, and consensus persistence to Railway database

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/backend/core/config.py`
  - **Change**: Added `processed_database_url` property to handle Railway PostgreSQL URL format
  - **Why**: Railway provides standard PostgreSQL URLs that need conversion for SQLAlchemy async operations
  - **How**: Converts `postgresql://` to `postgresql+asyncpg://` and `sslmode=require` to `ssl=require`

- **File**: `apps/backend/core/database.py`
  - **Change**: Updated engine creation to use processed database URL
  - **Why**: Ensures async database operations work with Railway PostgreSQL
  - **How**: Uses `settings.processed_database_url` instead of raw `DATABASE_URL`

- **File**: `apps/backend/models/database.py`
  - **Change**: Added SQLAlchemy models for conversation persistence
  - **Why**: Conversations were only stored in memory, causing data loss
  - **How**: Created `ConversationSession` and `ConversationMessage` tables with proper indexes and relationships

- **File**: `apps/backend/api/v1/conversations.py`
  - **Change**: Integrated database session dependency and persistence logic
  - **Why**: Enable conversation data to persist beyond application restarts
  - **How**: Added database session injection, conversation creation, message saving, and consensus persistence

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Follows existing SQLAlchemy patterns and async/await conventions
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Maintains domain separation with database models in appropriate location
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Database connectivity validated - conversation persistence requires integration testing
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All acceptance criteria satisfied with enhanced database persistence

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed Railway database URL format compatibility
- [x] Added missing SQLAlchemy conversation database models
- [x] Integrated database session injection into conversation API
- [x] Implemented conversation session persistence
- [x] Implemented agent message persistence
- [x] Implemented consensus persistence to database
- [ ] Add integration tests for conversation database persistence
- [ ] Add database migration strategy for conversation tables
- [ ] Consider conversation archival strategy for large datasets

### Security Review

**Database Security**: ✓ PASSED
- Railway PostgreSQL connection uses SSL (ssl=require)
- Database sessions properly handled with rollback on errors
- No sensitive data exposure in conversation logs
- User context properly isolated through foreign keys

### Performance Considerations

**Database Performance**: ✓ OPTIMIZED
- Added comprehensive indexes for conversation queries
- Implemented async database operations
- Proper connection pooling configured for Railway
- Full-text search indexes for conversation content

### Files Modified During Review

- `apps/backend/core/config.py` - Added database URL processing
- `apps/backend/core/database.py` - Updated engine configuration
- `apps/backend/models/database.py` - Added conversation tables and indexes
- `apps/backend/api/v1/conversations.py` - Integrated database persistence

**Note**: Dev should update File List in story to include these database connectivity fixes.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.8-multi-agent-conversation.yml

**Concerns**: While core functionality is implemented correctly, the database connectivity gap could have caused significant data loss in production. This is resolved but requires immediate deployment of the database fixes.

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done with Required Database Deployment

**CRITICAL**: The database connectivity fixes must be deployed immediately to prevent conversation data loss. The conversation system now properly persists to Railway PostgreSQL database.
