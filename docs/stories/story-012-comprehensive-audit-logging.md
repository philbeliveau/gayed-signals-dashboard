# Comprehensive Audit Logging - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **trading platform compliance officer**,
I want **detailed audit logging for all trading decisions and data operations**,
So that **regulatory compliance is maintained with complete transaction traceability**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Trading decision pipeline and existing logging infrastructure
- Technology: TypeScript audit logging service with structured log aggregation
- Follows pattern: Existing logging patterns and audit trail systems in the platform
- Touch points: Trading decision points, data operations, signal calculations, trading halts

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. All trading decisions logged with full context and reasoning
2. Data source usage and quality metrics tracked for compliance
3. Signal calculation audit trail captures all inputs and outputs
4. Trading halt events and reasons logged with timestamps

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Existing logging functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New audit logging follows existing logging patterns and infrastructure
7. Integration with monitoring systems maintains current alert behavior

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Change is covered by audit logging tests
9. Audit logging documentation is complete with compliance requirements
10. No regression in existing logging functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Create audit logging service and add logging to all critical operations
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Platform's existing logging infrastructure and patterns
- **Key Constraints:** Must capture compliance-required information without impacting performance

## Definition of Done
