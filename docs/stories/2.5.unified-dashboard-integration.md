  useEffect(() => {
    const socket = io('/autogen-conversations');
    socket.on('agent-message', (message: AgentMessage) => {
      setConversation(prev => [...prev, message]);
    });
    socket.on('conversation-complete', (result: ConversationResult) => {
      setIsActive(false);
      // Integrate with existing signal display
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <ConversationContainer className="bg-background border rounded-lg">
      {conversation.map(message => (
        <AgentMessageBubble key={message.id} agent={message.agent} content={message.content} />

**Mock Dashboard Integration:**
```typescript
// Complete dashboard testing with mock AutoGen
@testing-library/react
const renderDashboardWithMockAutoGen = () => {
  const mockConversation = {
    messages: [
      { agent: 'FinancialAnalyst', content: 'Mock analysis...', timestamp: Date.now() },
      { agent: 'MarketContext', content: 'Mock context...', timestamp: Date.now() + 1000 }
    ],
    isActive: true,
    signalContext: mockGayedSignals
  };

  return render(
    <DashboardProvider>
      <AutoGenIntegratedDashboard initialConversation={mockConversation} />
    </DashboardProvider>
  );
};

// Test real-time updates
test('displays AutoGen conversation in real-time', async () => {
  const { getByTestId } = renderDashboardWithMockAutoGen();

  // Simulate WebSocket message
  act(() => {
    mockWebSocket.emit('agent-message', {
      agent: 'RiskChallenger',
      content: 'Risk assessment complete',
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
  });

  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(getByTestId('conversation-display')).toContainElement(
      getByText('Risk assessment complete')
    );
  });
});
```
