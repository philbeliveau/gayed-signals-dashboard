# AutoGen Financial Intelligence Demo Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Demonstrate Microsoft AutoGen's multi-agent capabilities through live financial content analysis debates
- Establish partnership pathway with Croesus (19,000+ users managing $2T AUM) for white-label integration
- Create transparent AI reasoning system that builds trust between financial advisors and clients
- Develop production-ready multi-agent architecture suitable for wealth management platform integration
- Validate market demand for transparent AI reasoning in financial services industry

### Background Context

The financial analysis industry suffers from "black box" decision-making where investment recommendations lack transparent reasoning processes. Only 35% of investors trust that their advisor always acts in their best interest, and financial advisors spend 36% of their time preparing explanations for client meetings. Current financial AI tools provide conclusions without showing analytical processes, creating a trust gap that transparent multi-agent debates can address.

This project leverages existing Gayed signals infrastructure and creates a standalone demonstration platform where three specialized AutoGen agents (Financial Analyst, Market Context, Risk Challenger) engage in live debates about financial content, providing a new category of transparent AI reasoning tools for partnership with wealth management platforms like Croesus.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Clean, professional interface that projects credibility for financial services presentations. The design should feel sophisticated enough for Croesus partnership discussions while remaining intuitive for financial professionals who spend limited time learning new tools. Focus on transparency and clarity to reinforce the "transparent AI reasoning" value proposition.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Real-time conversation streaming**: Users watch agent debates unfold naturally without interruption
- **Content-first workflow**: Simple input → immediate agent analysis → exportable results
- **Professional presentation mode**: Clean export formatting suitable for client meetings
- **Session-based organization**: Multiple concurrent debates with clear session management

### Core Screens and Views
- **Landing/Demo Page**: Professional overview with sample conversation for partnership demonstrations
- **Content Input Screen**: Clean interface for Substack URLs, YouTube links, or direct text paste
- **Live Debate Interface**: Real-time agent conversation display with professional chat-like interface
- **Conversation History**: Session management and previous debate archives
- **Export Dashboard**: PDF generation and formatting options for client presentations
- **User Account/Settings**: Basic authentication and preference management

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Meeting WCAG AA standards to ensure compatibility with enterprise environments and potential regulatory requirements in financial services.

### Branding
Professional financial services aesthetic with clean typography and corporate color scheme. Avoid overly playful or consumer-focused design elements. The interface should reinforce trust and analytical sophistication - think Bloomberg Terminal meets modern SaaS rather than consumer fintech.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Web responsive design optimized for desktop (primary) and tablet (client presentations). Mobile viewing support but not mobile-optimized given the target user workflow of financial professionals conducting analysis during work hours.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing frontend (Next.js), backend (FastAPI), and shared utilities. This approach simplifies development coordination and deployment for the MVP while allowing future separation if needed for platform integration.

### Service Architecture
**AutoGen-Centric Microservices within Monorepo:** FastAPI backend service hosting Microsoft AutoGen agents, separate WebSocket service for real-time communications, PostgreSQL database service, and Redis cache service. All services deployed as separate Railway services but coordinated through shared repository.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing:** Unit tests for individual agent behaviors and API endpoints, integration tests for multi-agent conversations and WebSocket functionality. Focus on AutoGen conversation reliability and real-time performance validation rather than comprehensive testing pyramid given MVP timeline constraints.
