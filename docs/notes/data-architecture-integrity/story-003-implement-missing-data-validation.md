# Implement Missing Data Validation Method - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **trading platform system**,
I want **the missing validateMarketData method to be implemented and functional**,
So that **all market data is properly validated before being used in trading calculations**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: SignalOrchestrator class and API route validation pipeline
- Technology: TypeScript class methods with market data validation logic
- Follows pattern: Existing validation methods in the orchestrator
- Touch points: API route calling validateMarketData, signal processing pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. `SignalOrchestrator.validateMarketData()` method exists and is functional
2. Method validates all required symbols for completeness and freshness
3. Returns detailed validation results with warnings and error details

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing signal processing continues to work unchanged
5. New validation method follows existing orchestrator method patterns
6. Integration with API error handling maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Change is covered by comprehensive validation tests
8. Documentation is updated with validation method details
9. No regression in existing orchestrator functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Implement method in SignalOrchestrator class following existing validation patterns
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Similar validation methods in the orchestrator class
- **Key Constraints:** Must validate data quality without blocking legitimate trading operations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Overly strict validation blocking legitimate trading data
- **Mitigation:** Implement configurable validation thresholds and comprehensive testing
- **Rollback:** Disable validation method call if issues arise

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible
