# Implement Fail-Fast Error Handling - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **trading platform operator**,
I want **all signal calculation errors to halt trading instead of being silently ignored**,
So that **no trading decisions are made on corrupted or incomplete data**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Signal orchestrator error handling and trading pipeline
- Technology: TypeScript error handling with fail-fast patterns
- Follows pattern: Existing error handling infrastructure in the platform
- Touch points: Signal calculation methods, orchestrator error flow, API error responses

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. All signal calculation errors halt trading operations immediately
2. Clear error messages provided for operational debugging
3. No silent failures allowed in the trading pipeline

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing logging functionality continues to work unchanged
5. New fail-fast behavior follows existing error handling patterns
6. Integration with monitoring systems maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Change is covered by error scenario tests
8. Error handling documentation is updated
9. No regression in existing error reporting verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Update error handling in orchestrator to throw instead of catch and continue
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Platform's existing error handling and logging infrastructure
- **Key Constraints:** Must provide clear error context for debugging while preventing data corruption

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Overly aggressive error handling preventing legitimate operations
- **Mitigation:** Implement clear error categories and appropriate halt mechanisms
- **Rollback:** Revert to previous error handling behavior if needed

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible
