# Eliminate Financial Data Caching - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **trader using the platform**,
I want **all financial data to be real-time with no caching during market hours**,
So that **my trading decisions are based on the most current market conditions**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Market data client and API caching layer
- Technology: Next.js API routes with cache TTL configuration
- Follows pattern: Existing cache management system with configurable TTL
- Touch points: API route cache settings, market data client caching logic

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. CACHE_TTL set to 0 for all financial data endpoints
2. No cached responses served during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
3. Real-time data freshness validation implemented

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing non-financial data caching continues to work unchanged
5. New real-time behavior follows existing cache pattern configuration
6. Integration with market data client maintains current API interface

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Change is covered by cache behavior tests
8. Performance impact is monitored and documented
9. No regression in non-financial data caching verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Update cache TTL settings in API routes and remove caching logic from market data client
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Current cache configuration system with TTL management
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain API performance while ensuring data freshness

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Increased API latency due to removal of caching
- **Mitigation:** Monitor performance and implement optimized real-time data fetching
- **Rollback:** Restore previous cache TTL settings if performance issues occur

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is monitored and acceptable
