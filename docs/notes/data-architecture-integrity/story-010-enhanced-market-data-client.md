# Enhanced Market Data Client - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **trading platform system**,
I want **improved market data client with better error handling and data source management**,
So that **data quality is maintained through enhanced source validation and connection monitoring**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Market data services and data source management infrastructure
- Technology: TypeScript market data client with failover logic and connection health monitoring
- Follows pattern: Existing market data client architecture and error handling patterns
- Touch points: Data source configuration, failover mechanisms, error handling pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Single authoritative data source per calculation to ensure consistency
2. Improved error handling and logging for data source issues
3. Data quality validation at source before processing
4. Connection health monitoring with automatic failover capabilities

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Existing market data functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New enhanced client follows existing data client patterns
7. Integration with signal processing maintains current data flow

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Change is covered by data source scenario tests
9. Market data client documentation is updated
10. No regression in existing data retrieval verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Refactor data source failover logic and add consistency validation
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Current market data client architecture and error handling
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain data reliability while improving source management

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Data source switching causing inconsistent market data
- **Mitigation:** Implement thorough data source validation and consistency checks
- **Rollback:** Revert to previous data client if source issues arise

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible
