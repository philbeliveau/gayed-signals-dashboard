# Signal Orchestrator Enhancement - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **trading platform system**,
I want **the signal orchestrator to use all 5 signals and enforce completeness requirements**,
So that **trading decisions are based on the complete Gayed signal methodology**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: SignalOrchestrator class and all signal engine implementations
- Technology: TypeScript orchestrator with signal configuration and consensus calculation
- Follows pattern: Existing orchestrator signal management and configuration patterns
- Touch points: Orchestrator configuration, consensus calculation logic, signal completeness validation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. All 5 signals enabled and integrated in orchestrator configuration
2. Consensus calculation uses complete signal set for accurate results
3. Fast mode maintains data integrity standards while using all signals

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing signal processing continues to work unchanged
5. New complete signal configuration follows existing orchestrator patterns
6. Integration with API maintains current response format and behavior

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Change is covered by signal completeness tests
8. Orchestrator configuration documentation is updated
9. No regression in existing orchestrator functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Update orchestrator configuration to enable all signals and modify consensus calculation
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Current orchestrator signal management and configuration system
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain performance while ensuring all signals contribute to decisions

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Performance degradation from processing all 5 signals
- **Mitigation:** Optimize signal processing and implement performance monitoring
- **Rollback:** Revert to previous signal configuration if performance issues occur

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is monitored and acceptable

**Story Details:**
- **Story ID:** STORY-008
- **Points:** 8
- **Priority:** P1 - HIGH
- **Phase:** Phase 2 - Signal Implementation Completion
- **Epic:** Critical Data Integrity Overhaul (EPIC-001)
