# 🚨 EPIC: Critical Data Integrity Overhaul for Trading Platform

**Epic ID:** `EPIC-001`
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Classification:** Security & Data Integrity
**Estimated Effort:** 40-60 hours
**Target Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Risk Level:** BUSINESS CRITICAL

---

## 🎯 **EPIC OVERVIEW**

### **Problem Statement**
The current trading platform contains 15+ critical data integrity violations that pose significant risks to trading accuracy, including hardcoded API credentials, financial data caching, incomplete signal calculations, and missing validation mechanisms. These issues violate the fundamental requirement for "real" and "up to date" data in trading decisions.

### **Business Impact**
- **Financial Risk:** Incorrect trading signals could lead to significant losses
- **Security Risk:** Exposed API credentials and data breaches
- **Compliance Risk:** Automated trading on stale/invalid data
- **Operational Risk:** Platform unreliability during market volatility

### **Success Criteria**
- ✅ Zero hardcoded credentials in codebase
- ✅ Real-time data validation with no caching of financial data
- ✅ Complete implementation of all 5 Gayed signals (100% vs current 40%)
- ✅ Fail-fast error handling preventing trading on corrupted data
- ✅ Comprehensive audit trail and monitoring
- ✅ 100% test coverage for all trading-critical calculations
