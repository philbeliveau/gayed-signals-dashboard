Task: Refactor all code that manually queries the FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) API to use the Python fredapi package instead.

üîß What You Should Do:
Install the Library (if not already):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install fredapi
Replace Manual API Calls (i.e., anything using requests, urllib, or raw HTTP) with structured calls via the Fred class.

Use Environment Variable for the API Key:

Use os.environ["FRED_API_KEY"] so that the key is not hardcoded.

Expect the user to define this in their .env file or system environment.

Data Access Pattern:

Replace any JSON parsing of API responses with:

python
Copy
Edit
from fredapi import Fred
import os

fred = Fred(api_key=os.environ["FRED_API_KEY"])
data = fred.get_series("FEDFUNDS")
Expected Return Format:

Return the data as a pandas.Series with a datetime index.

Ensure it integrates smoothly with any existing data processing or charting logic.

Add Error Handling:

Gracefully handle missing series, invalid keys, or API downtime with try/except blocks.

üìÅ Files to Modify
Locate all FRED API calls in Python scripts (search for fred.stlouisfed.org)

Refactor the call logic and any data transformation accordingly

Update documentation/comments to reflect the simpler new structure

üéØ Final Goal
You should end up with:

Cleaner, more readable code

Native pandas integration

No more manual URL building or data parsing

API keys stored securely

Let me know if you need to add helper methods for:

Metadata retrieval

Series search

Bulk time series queries
