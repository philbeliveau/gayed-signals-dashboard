 React Chart Rendering Issue: Debugging Documentation

  üîç Current Problem State

  A Next.js application with Recharts is failing to render charts despite all data loading correctly. Charts appear as blank/dark areas.

  ‚úÖ What We Know Works

  - Data fetching: API calls return correct data (12 housing points, 52 labor points)
  - Component mounting: No JavaScript errors, components render
  - Data transformation: Console shows successful processing
  - Build system: No TypeScript/compilation errors

  ‚ùå What's Not Working

  - Chart visualization: Recharts components render nothing visible
  - User sees blank/gray areas where charts should be

  üî¨ Debugging Steps Attempted

  Step 1: Data Pipeline Verification

  # API endpoints confirmed working
  curl "http://localhost:3000/api/housing" # Returns 12 data points
  curl "http://localhost:3000/api/labor"   # Returns 52 data points

  Result: ‚úÖ Data pipeline is completely functional

  Step 2: Component-Level Debugging

  Added diagnostic information to identify the failure point:

  // Added debug output
  <div className="bg-yellow-100 text-black p-2">
    DEBUG: Data={housingData.length} | Mounted={typeof window !== 'undefined'} | LineChart={typeof LineChart}
  </div>

  Observed Output: DEBUG: Data=12 | Mounted= | LineChart=function
  Key Finding: The Mounted= field was empty, suggesting hydration issues

  Step 3: Isolation Testing

  Created a fallback chart without dynamic imports to test if the issue was:
  - Data (ruled out)
  - Recharts library
  - SSR/hydration
  - CSS/styling

  // Simple bar chart test - THIS WORKED
  <div className="h-40 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-200 to-blue-400 relative">
    {housingData.slice(0, 5).map((point, i) => (
      <div style={{ height: `${point.caseSillerIndex}px` }}>
        {point.caseSillerIndex}
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>

  Result: ‚úÖ Fallback chart rendered correctly, confirming data works

  Step 4: CSS Variable Investigation

  Suspected CSS custom properties weren't resolving in chart context:

  // Changed from:
  stroke="var(--theme-primary)"
  // To:
  stroke="#3B82F6"

  Result: ‚ùì No immediate change observed

  Step 5: NoSSRWrapper Analysis

  Original code used a NoSSRWrapper component:
  const NoSSRWrapper = ({ children, fallback }) => {
    const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
    useEffect(() => setMounted(true), []);
    return mounted ? children : fallback;
  };

  Hypothesis: The mounting detection was failing

  üîß Current Attempted Fix (UNCONFIRMED)

  Replaced NoSSRWrapper with direct client state management:

  // Added to component
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsClient(true);
  }, []);

  // Changed render logic
  {!isClient ? (
    <div>Loading chart...</div>
  ) : (
    <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={350}>
      <LineChart data={housingData}>
        {/* chart components */}
      </LineChart>
    </ResponsiveContainer>
  )}

  ‚ùì What Needs Verification

  1. Does the isClient fix work?
    - Need to check if debug now shows IsClient=true
    - Need to verify if Recharts actually renders
  2. Is this actually an SSR issue?
    - Could be CSS/styling problems
    - Could be dynamic import timing
    - Could be ResponsiveContainer size calculation
  3. Alternative approaches to try:
    - Remove dynamic imports entirely
    - Use static imports with different SSR strategy
    - Test with fixed dimensions instead of ResponsiveContainer
    - Try different chart library (Chart.js, D3)

  üîÑ Next Steps for Investigation

  Immediate Verification Needed

  # 1. Refresh the housing/labor tabs
  # 2. Check what the debug output shows now
  # 3. Look for any console errors
  # 4. Verify if actual charts appear

  If Current Fix Doesn't Work, Try:

  Option A: Static Imports
  import { LineChart, XAxis, YAxis, ResponsiveContainer } from 'recharts';
  // Remove all dynamic() calls

  Option B: Force Client-Side Only
  // In layout.tsx or page component
  {typeof window !== 'undefined' && <ChartComponent />}

  Option C: Fixed Dimensions
  // Replace ResponsiveContainer
  <div style={{ width: '800px', height: '400px' }}>
    <LineChart width={800} height={400} data={data}>

  Option D: Different Chart Library
  // Try Chart.js or native SVG instead of Recharts

  üìã Status: DEBUGGING IN PROGRESS

  - ‚úÖ Problem isolated to chart rendering (not data)
  - ‚úÖ Likely SSR/hydration related
  - ‚è≥ Fix attempt applied but not confirmed
  - ‚ùì Need user verification of current state

  For the next AI: Start by asking the user what they see after the latest changes, then proceed based on whether the isClient approach worked or if we need to try the alternative
  approaches listed above.
